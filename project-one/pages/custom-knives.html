            This page is about one of my hobbies, I love to customize things. Before, I would buy a lot of used shoes to repair and customize them with my own little touch of art.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Nowadays I have been really interested in making and customizing knives, such as fixed blade knives and pocket knives for (EDC) Every Day Carry. Some of the knives you see in this page, I have done some customizations to the handle, scales and the blade shape.
            It's something that brings me a lot of joy, when finally seeing the finished product that I have modified and added my own touches of art and creativity to it.
